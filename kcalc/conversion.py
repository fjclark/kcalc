    Calculate the dissociation constant (Kd) from the standard free energy of binding (Î”G).

    Args:
        dg (float): Standard free energy of binding in kcal/mol.
        temp (float, optional): Temperature in Kelvin. Default is 298.15 K.

    Returns:
        float: Dissociation constant Kd in M.

    Notes:
        The equation used to calculate Kd is:

        $$
        K_d = e^{\\frac{\\Delta G}{RT}}
        $$

        where $\\Delta G$ is the standard free energy of binding,
        $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin.
